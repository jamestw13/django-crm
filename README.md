# Django CRM
### An app built from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t10QcFx7d5k) to keep me fresh with Python and SQL ODM skills. Getting more experience with Django.

A very simple CRM with user authentication, and record ADD/REMOVE/UPDATE functionality. Bootstrap for quick design.
Uses MySQL for a database
